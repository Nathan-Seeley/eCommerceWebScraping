# eCommerceWebScraping

Q: What was the biggest challenge of scraping the web site?
A: 1- Determining if I needed to utilize the wait() function.
   2- Following the XPATH in order to get the "number of reviews" data.  I lost the trail a couple of times and had to start over.
   3- Formatting and sorting the .csv file by price.

Q: What insight, if any, did you gain from the analysis and visualization of the laptop data?
A: There does not seem to be a strong correlation between the price of the laptop and the number of reviews.
However, there is a slight trend showing that the higher the price of the item the more reviews there are.
